# Machine Learning

## Task Specification
- Explore the [dataset](https://github.com/beoutbreakprepared/nCoV2019/tree/master/latest_data) and define ONE problem to solve, with motivations.
- Choose any 3 machine learning algorithms that are sophisticated and appropriate to solve the problem.
- Build 3 predictive models and make comparisons between them.
- Write a scientific report (in a style of an academic paper).

## Scientific Report
- Articulate the problem you plan to solve, and the methodology you plan to use. 
- Provide necessary tables and charts to summarise and support the comparisons.
- Discuss the results and draw conclusions from your experimentation.
